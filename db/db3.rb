  Post.create(title: 'GADESCO',
  body: "Hello there,\n\nThis is post number one for me. I thought I would start this blog in order to talk about what I'm up to... both the projects and sounds I'm making and how I'm making them.  \n\n**number 1 - Gadesco** \n\n !!!rp!!!https://vimeo.com/156655542!!!rp!!! \n\n\nRecently, I came out with [Physical Therapy](http://iomcoi.com/), my first record under my own name. This is coming after 2 Brazos records I wrote as well, but it is such a departure from those sounds that it didn’t feel like a Brazos record. I decided to release music under my own name because I’m interested in branching out into scoring, sound design and production, and I want it all under the same roof. I did have some help on this from Ian Chang and Spencer Zahn who played with me in Brazos.\n\nThe song above is one of my favorites from this record. I wrote it almost 10 years ago in Austin, and I've made 4 or 5 recordings of it since, but I never could get it quite right. This one feels the closest, and I really love what Zachary Heinzerling did with the video. It’s funny how songs can stay with you over the years. They serve as a 3rd reference point by which to triangulate your relationship with your former self, to see just how much you’ve changed (or haven’t).\n\n**number 2 - Scoring**  \n\n2015 was also the year I started writing to picture. My first project was Hugh The Hunter, a short film by Zachary Heinzerling. That went to Sundance 2015 and is now available on [NOWNESS](https://www.nowness.com/story/hugh-the-hunter-zachary-heinzerling-hugh-hayden).\\n I spent the rest of the year finishing my record and working with Zachary and [Sweet Fern Productions](http://www.sweetfernproductions.com/) on some web docs that turned out really nicely. Check back in for what I'm up to. I've got some awesome projects in the works! \n\nMC",
