  It cracks me up every time I see it, which makes working on it a real pleasure.</p>

The whole process has been very exciting, and it's being documented in a short film. Expect to see updates here over the next few months!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also starting the beginning stages of music supervision / scoring for Bentley Heyman's debut feature. Shooting tentatively begins in June! Will post updates as well.</p>

      <p>Here is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ianyhchang/">Ian Chang</a>'s debut video for his new project using <a target="_blank" href="http://sunhou.se/">Sensory Percussion</a> (originally posted over at <a target="_blank" href="http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/sample-based-drums-psychedelic-light-show">The Creator's Project</a>). It's always exciting to see a new music technology get stretched out in the hands of an artist.</p>
      <p>I mixed this track and helped produce it. If you scroll down this blog, you can hear a sample instrument, spiritual leader, I built that Ian sampled at the end of this track. He's got more songs coming out, and they are all great.</p>

for the drums and synths, so almost every sound on the record is custom made.</p>

{title: `GADESCO`,
author: `Martin Crane`,
text: `<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>This is post number one for me. I thought I would start this blog in order to talk about what I'm up to... both the projects and sounds I'm making and how I'm making them.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>number 1 - Gadesco</strong></p>
<ReactPlayer url="https://vimeo.com/156655542" />
<p>Recently, I came out with <a target="_blank" href="http://iomcoi.com/">Physical Therapy</a>, my first record under my own name. This is coming after 2 Brazos records I wrote as well, but it is such a departure from those sounds that it didn’t feel like a Brazos record. I decided to release music under my own name because I’m interested in branching out into scoring, sound design and production, and I want it all under the same roof. I did have some help on this from Ian Chang and   Spencer Zahn who played with me in Brazos</p>
<p>The song above is one of my favorites from this record. I wrote it almost 10 years ago in Austin, and I've made 4 or 5 recordings of it since, but I never could get it quite right. This one feels the closest, and I really love what Zachary Heinzerling did with the video. It’s funny how songs can stay with you over the years. They serve as a 3rd reference point by which to triangulate your relationship with your former self, to see just how much you’ve changed (or haven’t).</p>
<p><strong>number 2 - Scoring</strong></p>
<p>2015 was also the year I started writing to picture. My first project was <a href="/hugh-the-hunter">Hugh the Hunter</a>, a short film by Zachary Heinzerling. That went to Sundance 2015 and is now available on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nowness.com/story/hugh-the-hunter-zachary-heinzerling-hugh-hayden">NOWNESS</a>.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the year finishing my record and working with Zachary and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sweetfernproductions.com/">Sweet Fern Productions</a> on some web docs that turned out really nicely. Check back in for what I'm up to. I've got some awesome projects in the works!</p>
